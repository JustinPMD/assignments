## Challenge: Reiner Knizia's Decathlon Game

### Preamble

Reiner Knizia is one of my favorite game designers. Over the course of his career, he has produced an [_amazing_ number of very solid games](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank&advsearch=1&q=&include[designerid]=2&include[publisherid]=&range[yearpublished][min]=&range[yearpublished][max]=&range[minage][max]=&range[numvoters][min]=&range[numweights][min]=&range[minplayers][max]=&range[maxplayers][min]=&range[playingtime][max]=&floatrange[avgrating][min]=&floatrange[avgrating][max]=&floatrange[avgweight][min]=&floatrange[avgweight][max]=&searchuser=bwingrave&playerrangetype=normal&B1=Submit)  with a unique Knizia feel.

In 2003, Reiner released [Decathlon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6955/reiner-knizias-decathlon), a print-and-play [push your luck](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/55666/push-your-luck-games) dice game.

**The Game**

Please familiarize yourself with the [rules](https://knizia.de/wp-content/uploads/reiner/pdfs/Knizia-Website-Decathlon.pdf).

There is also a useful [video review with walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPIAYl9WXsg) available on YouTube.

I found this [scoring sheet](files/decathlon_sheet.pdf) helpful as well.

### What you're going to build

I'd like you to build a functioning 1-player version of the game.

Depending on the grade you'd like, what features you need to create differ. Please refer to the [rubric](asg.03.rubric.md) for details.
