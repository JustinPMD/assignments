# BeastCard Docs

## Preamble

This is a class you need to make.

Its job in life is to represent a beast card. The code used here is **very** similar to code that you used in the `WEEK-03: MtG card` drill.

## Public Methods You Need To Make

### public BeastCard(`String`, `String`)

> This is the constructor.
>
> The parameters are the name and cost, respectively, of the given card.
>
> It's a good idea to make sure that you store the cost off in capital letters; it'll make some things easier later on.

### public String name()

> This method returns the name of this card.

### public String cost()

> This method returns the cost of this card.

### public String toString()

> This is optional; you may find it useful for debugging.
