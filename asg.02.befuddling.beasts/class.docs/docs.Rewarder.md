# Rewarder Docs

## Preamble

This is a class you need to make.

Its job in life is to behave like the rewarder described in the **WEEK-04: rewarder** drill. I won't repeat how it behaves here.

## Public Methods You Need To Make

### constructor

> You don't need to make one - the default will be fine. (Remember to use appropriate instance variable initializers, though!)
>
> If you **do** decide to make one - and I won't hold it against you if you do - make sure it is a **no-arg constructor**.

### public void setThresholdOne(`int`, `int`)
### public void setThresholdTwo(`int`, `int`)
### public void setThresholdThree(`int`, `int`)
### public int reward(`int`)

> These behave just as they do in the REPL drill.

### public String toString()

> This is optional; you may find it useful for debugging.
