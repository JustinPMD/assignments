# Assignment 01 Rubric

Code is not only meant to be **run**; it's also meant to be **read**. As such, I consider it equally important that your code _does what it's supposed to do_ **AND** _be easy to read and understand_. The marking scheme reflects this.

An assignment is also an excellent opportunity to open up a conversation between a reader of the code (that's me) and the writer of the code (that's you). Getting feedback about what you've created - both the "good" and the "needs work" part - is super important. As such, instead of providing some quick cookie-cutter comments, I am willing (and eager!) to sit down with each student and go over their code with them. So if you want to have that conversation - and I hope you do - please contact me in person or by email after you get your marks back and we'll arrang a mutually-acceptable time when we can talk about your code.

## Judo Scoring Challenge

### Grade Levels

#### A Level

> If your code successfully passes all tests and is easy to understand, you'll get an A. Whether the A is an A-, A, or A+ depends on how well you followed the [design guidelines](design.guidelines).

#### B Level

> If your code successfully passes most of the tests, with a minor bug or two, but is still easy to follow, you've got yourself a B. I know that "most of the tests" sounds vague. I agree.
>
> As with an A, whether you get a B+, B, or B- depends on how well you follow the design guidelines.

#### C Level

> A C level solution is like a B, but with more failing tests and/or more code that is hard to read and understand. A C level solution tends to leave the user with an impression that "it kinda works".
>
> As with an A, whether you get a C+, C, or C- depends on how well you follow the design guidelines.

#### D Level

> If your code doesn't compile, that's a D. This may seem a bit harsh, but your should be compiling as you go along, fixing any compilation errors as they pop up.
>
> You will also get a D for compiling code that implements very few (if any) of the necessary features.

#### F Level

> You'll get an F if you didn't hand anything in.
> You'll also get an F if you're wildly off-base.
